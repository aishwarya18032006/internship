    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <img src="sun">
    <p>The Sun is a star, the source of light and heat for our solar system. It is a giant ball of hot gas, mainly hydrogen and helium, that powers life on Earth. Its energy, generated by nuclear fusion, drives photosynthesis and warms our planet.</p>
    <h2> The Lifeline of Our Solar System</h2>
    <p>The Sun is a massive ball of hot, glowing gases that lies at the heart of our solar system. Comprising about 99.8% of the solar system's total mass, it is the central source of light and energy for all life on Earth. Without the Sun, life as we know it would not exist.

        Scientifically, the Sun is a medium-sized star made primarily of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%). Through a process known as nuclear fusion, hydrogen atoms in the Sun's core are converted into helium, releasing an enormous amount of energy. This energy travels to Earth in the form of sunlight, which provides warmth, drives weather patterns, and powers photosynthesis in plants.
        
        The Sun’s surface temperature is approximately 5,500°C, while its core can reach a staggering 15 million°C. It is located about 150 million kilometers from Earth, a distance referred to as one astronomical unit (AU).
        
        Apart from giving us daylight, the Sun also influences the Earth's seasons and climate. Its gravitational pull keeps the planets, asteroids, and comets in orbit, maintaining the structure of the solar system.
        
        Although the Sun has been shining for about 4.6 billion years, it is currently in its middle age. Scientists estimate that it has enough fuel to last for another 5 billion years, after which it will evolve into a red giant and eventually settle as a white dwarf.
        
        In conclusion, the Sun is not just a bright object in the sky — it is the very foundation of life on Earth. Understanding and appreciating its role helps us realize how connected we are to the vast universe around us.
